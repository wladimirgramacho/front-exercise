## Crypto BB

This is an exercise made by Wladimir Gramacho for the **BxBlue Recruiting Program**. BxBlue is a brazilian startup that works with payroll loans.

To view the exercise, follow the standard Ruby on Rails commands:

1. Clone the repository and move to the repository's directory.

2. `bundle install`

3. `rails db:setup`

4. `rails server`

The database already contains some types of coins and two users:

	wladi = User.create(name: 'Wladimir', email: 'wladimirgramacho@gmail.com', password: '123456')
	fabs = User.create(name: 'Fabs', email: 'fabs@gmail.com', password: '123456')

Using those informations, you can manage your wallet, buy and sell coins. Any questions, please address them to wladimirgramacho@gmail.com. **Regards!**
